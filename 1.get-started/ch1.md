# Structuring React Apps: Get Started

# Chapter 1: Enforcing format rules

The're only two sides of this coin, you either:

- Don't care at all mixing single quotes with duoble ones,
  adding semicolons whenever you feel like it, adding spaces in a completely random manner,
  declaring variables that will never be used and
  can't stand the editor highliting in red tiny errors.

**OR**

- Think that code is meant to be read by people and therefore anything that can be
  added to improve its readability is 100% worth it. You also think that having consistency
  in how the code is presented adds in quality.

No matter which side you're currently in, we'll go through the process of configuring some
tools that will handle formatting and linting. You'll see how easy it is to set up these tools and how helpful they're for development.

## Initialize a new react app

```
npx create-react-app my-app
```

## Configure Eslint

> Remember to install the VS code extension [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
