# Structuring React Apps

# Building ui components

## Motivation

* Why would I do this from scratch?
* Is it like building my own UI Library?

Being able to **develop from scratch** every single little element of an entire Web Application is a skill that not many have, it takes a lot of discipline and effort to care for every `px` that you see in a Mockup Design.

Being able to create such **smoothness** in a Web Page where everything seems to just appear and disappear at **60FPS**.

Being able to write **complex validation logic**, complex **data parsing** for display is something that will stregenthen anyones ability to solve the **hardest of the problems**.

That said let's start this section of building **every element from sractch**.
