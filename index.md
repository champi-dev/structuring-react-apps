# Goal
To thoroughly expose the thought process involved in every step related to the development of a complex React Project.

## What I mean by complex
A complex React Project is one that:

* Has to enforce linting/formatting rules to a development team.
* Needs to manage styles according to a UI guide style.
* Does not use a UI library but rather has it's own ui components written from scratch.
* Has container screens that need to share data with many children components.
* Manages and parses data coming from a web server.
* Handles different permissions in the app based on user role (e.g. private routes).
* Has unit tests to verify correctness of both UI logic (i.e. containers/components) and Business Data logic (i.e. redux).
