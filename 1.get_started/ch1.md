# Structuring React Apps: Get Started

# Chapter 1: Enforcing format rules

The're only two sides of this coin:

- You don't care at all mixing single quotes with duoble ones,
  adding semicolons whenever you feel like it, adding spaces in a completely random manner,
  declaring variables that will never be used and
  can't stand the editor highliting in red tiny errors.

**OR**

- You think that code is meant to be read by people and therefore anything that can be
  added to improve its readability is 100% worth it. You also think that having consistency
  in how the code is presented adds in quality.
